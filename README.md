# Year-Two-App
An app I designed for the two year anniversary of me and my long distance girlfriend.

This app has several main functions:

- A messaging service for just the two of us. The app uses the firebase database service to store messages with unique tags and dates so that either phone can load them properly, and the app is constantly refreshing
- A bucket list service. This allows each of us to add things we want to do in the picture along with full descriptions, locations, dates, and photos. Either person can view items once they are added. Once completed, they are moved to a completed section where a description of the completion as well as a picture is shown! Items can be sorted alphabetically or chronologically
- A relationship timing service. This keeps track of the exact amount of time it's been since we got together. The app gives the time in two different ways: one with the units combined to show the correct time (ex: 1 minute 30 seconds), and one where the units are all individual (ex: 1 minute 90 seconds)
- A countdown until our next visit. This allows us to submit visit dates and descriptions similar to items in the bucket list. The app then gives a countdown to the next approaching visit, as well as who is visiting who.
- A semester tracking service. This keeps track of how much of our long distance we've completed, and how much is left to go! The app also keeps track of how many days are left in the current semester, as well as what percentage we are complete.

Since the app was made specifically for the two of us, I hardcoded the username and ID into the application, however if I ever plan to expand the user base of this application, I would add a login and proper user system.
